HOW TO INSTALL CMS
=======================

Notice: This module needs ImpressCMS 1.3 or higer.

1. Cms is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should copy the beendet /cms folder into the /modules directory of your website. Then, log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the cms icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.

2. Cms has OPTIONAL tagging support via the Sprockets module, which must be installed separately. This enables your cms to be sorted and filtered by tag, making the module a lot more useful.
